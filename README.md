Exercise: Flexbox  https://classroom.github.com/a/wjaZPIdj

Define a class for our flex container (as we saw today):
- it must display flex obviously
- it must have a border
- add some margin top and bottom

Create a class for our boxes:
- each side must be 200px long
- give them some borders so that we can distinguish them
- use box-sizing so that border and padding are included in the element width/height

Note: when you place boxes in containers, make them distinguishable by adding "Box 1", "Box 2", "Box 3", ... as content
Add 8 boxes to the container
1) Box 3, 4, and 7 must have a 13-words long lorem-ipsum
2) The width of boxes 4 and 7 must adapt to the content (there is a flex-property for this)
3) Color boxes 1, 5 and 6 with a tomato background (using nth-of-type, just for practice...)
4) Boxes 1 and 5 must shrink 2 times faster then the other elements
